        Compile-time errors: Errors found by the compiler. We can further classify compile-time errors based on which language rules they violate, for example:
        Syntax errors
        Type errors
        Link-time errors: Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable program.
        Run-time errors: Errors found by checks in a running program. We can further classify run-time errors as
        Errors detected by the computer (hardware and/or operating system)
        Errors detected by a library (e.g., the standard library)
        Errors detected by user code
        Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.

    -Errors that can be ignored in student programs
        1. Should produce the desired results for all legal inputs
        2. Should give reasonable error messages for all illegal inputs
        3. Need not worry about misbehaving hardware
        4. Need not worry about misbehaving system software
        5. Is allowed to terminate after finding an error
    -What guarantees should every completed project offer?
        1. Should produce the desired results for all legal inputs
        2. Should give reasonable error messages for all illegal inputs
        3. Need not worry about misbehaving hardware
        4. Need not worry about misbehaving system software
        5. Is allowed to terminate after finding an error
    -Three approaches to eliminate errors and produce accetable software
        Organize software to minimize errors
        Debugging and testing
        The remeaning errors should not be serious
